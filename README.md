# Metagenomics_Workshop

This is the repository from the workshop held at Kasetsart university on 11th June 2024. There are two main tools for 16S analysis: QIIME2 and DADA2. This workshop will follow DADA2 as it is easier to install on local computer in R, however, QIIME2 installation and usage can be found in: http://qiime.org/tutorials/index.html.

1. file labelled "installation_guide_DADA2.R" can be used to upload libraries required for the workshop
2. create a folder directory for all your raw fasta sequences and set path using
   path <- "~/yourpath/data_microbiota/"
3. create a folder with taxa for Silva database. original can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/1172783 depending on your 16S amplicon primer region.
